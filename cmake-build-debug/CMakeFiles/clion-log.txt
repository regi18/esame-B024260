  the following names:

    Qt6Config.cmake
    qt6-config.cmake
    Qt5Config.cmake
    qt5-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "QT" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "QT_DIR" to
  a directory containing one of the above files.  If "QT" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
